Welcome to this fun little game i made. There's not much to do to be exact, all you do in the game is just... well... close pop ups.

Yes, that's all i have to say. Do something, either go outside or play this game. No inbeetweem.



ALSO if you're reading the code DON'T MIND ABOUT THE FACT THAT I'M USING SWING
I NEVER HEARD ABOUT JAVAFX BEING SWING BUT BETTER UNTIL NOW (7/16/23)
dw im using javafx in my future projects <3

NOTE

This is the older version of Pop Up Blocker. I had trouble with installing Gradle so ended up making new repo. Yes there's probably a way to just... well yeah but I don't give a fuck. If it works it works

*Never say that again. Especially in programming.*

actually now that i think about it you're supposed to say that, "if it works it works"
